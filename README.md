This small project was mostly done to better understand how Levenberg Marquardt and Simulated Annealing both work, and also become
more proficient in C#.NET

They are adaptations of MATLAB codes.

For Simulated annealing:  https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33109-simulated-annealing-optimization

For Levenberg-Marquardt: lm.m on page 7 of http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/ce281/lm.pdf

For LM Matrix operations, Math.Net.Numerics was used to make things. However, it would be interesting to write out Matrix inversion
and Multiplications later on.

This code can still be improved. However, I am happy to have been able to understand the steps of each algorithm.
